# The Calculator project
is a web-based calculator application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic calculations and execute various mathematical functions. The calculator supports both keyboard input and button clicks for interaction.


## A Lot Of Features:
>1-Arithmetic Operations: The calculator allows users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations on numeric values.

>2-Parentheses: Users can use parentheses to group and prioritize mathematical expressions.

>3-Mathematical functions: The calculator provides additional mathematical functions such as square, sine, cosine, tangent, and square root.

>4-Keyboard support: Users can enter numbers and perform operations using a computer keyboard.

>5-Display screen: The calculator displays the current coefficient, the previous coefficient, and the selected operation.

>6-Error Handling: The calculator handles invalid inputs and prevents calculations when there are missing operands or undefined operations.

>7-Copy output: Users can copy the current result to the clipboard by clicking on the copy button.


## The Calculator class provides the following methods:

>clear(): Clears the current operand, the previous operand, and the operation.

>delete(): removes the last character of the current operand.

>appendNumber (number): Appends a number or decimal point to the current operand.

>selectOperation(operation): Handles the selection of various operations, including basic arithmetic operations and mathematical functions.

>handleParentheses(parenthesis): Handles adding parentheses to the current parameter.

>Square (): Calculate the square of the current modulus.

>sin(): Calculate the sine of the current coefficient.

>cos(): Calculates the cosine of the current coefficient.

>tan(): calculate the tangent of the current modulus.

>sqrt(): Calculates the square root of the current coefficient.

>compute(): Computes the current expression.

>updateDisplay(): Updates the display elements with the current and previous parameters.

>copyOutput(): copies the current parameter to the clipboard and displays an alert with the result.

>RegisterKeyboardEvents (): Set up event listeners for keyboard input.
event listeners

## The script also includes event listeners for button clicks and keyboard input. These event listeners call the relevant methods of the calculator instance to handle user input and update the view accordingly. 

>1-Number buttons: Attach event listeners to append numbers to the current operand.

>2-Trigger buttons: Attach event listeners to select different operations.

>3-equals button: enclose an event listener for the calculation action.

>4-Delete button: Attach an event listener to delete the last character of the current parameter.

>5-Clear All button: Attach an event listener to clear the state of the calculator.

>6-Copy button: Attach an event listener to copy the current parameter to the clipboard.
